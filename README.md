# Entity Framework 6 Power Tools Community Edition

This is a fork of the "official" EF 6 repository, which hosts the Visual Studio 2015 and 2017 version of EF Power Tools Beta. 

# What are the Power Tools?

# Downloads/builds

**Release**

The Power Tools will remain in "beta" status, but I hope to be able to publish a build to the Visual Studio MarketPlace, so it will be easily available via Tools - Extensions and Updates in Visual Studio.

You can download the daily build from [VSIX Gallery](http://vsixgallery.com/extensions/F0A7D01D-4834-44C3-99B2-5907A0701906/extension.vsix).
